                <h2>
                Future Mechatronics Engineer
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm Arabella, a recent HSC graduate who is passionate about robotics, python and open-source experimentation. I'm commited to 
						documenting my work and making it as simple and effective as possible, so that, hopefully, I can inspire others. I'm a high-achieving 
						student who got band 6s in Physics and Software Engineering, an E4 and E3 in Maths Extension 1 and 2, respectively, and was ranked 7th in 
						NSW for Engineering Studies, giving me a 97.7 ATAR. Although I'm proud of my results, it's not about the grades for me, but the love of learning 
						and desire to understand and contribute to the world around me.
					</p>
					<p>
						I started coding in Scratch when I was 8, and I've been programming in python and other text-based languages for 7 years now. 
						I am an avid Python programmer and competent in a variety of related libraries such as Pygame, SQLite and Flask, and I have also 
						experimented with C++ for the Arduino, ATMega328-PU and ATTiny85, C# for Unity game development and other software such as EasyEDA to make 
						custom PCBs, Adobe Animate, Blender and Solidworks. In 2023 I was awarded the ADF Future Innovators Award for projects such as 
						<a href='https://github.com/boatartist/Tori-Tortoise' class='heading-link'>Tori Tortoise</a>, and I presented my Raspberry Pi 
						based robotic bird phone "<a href="https://github.com/boatartist/Phones-Arent-Real" class='heading-link'>Phones Aren't Real</a>" at the 2025 PyConAU 
						Education Showcase. 
						I'm also a keen rower, an avid reader, and have the cutest dog ever, Sally!

                <p>
                    Challenging my attention span and the idea of a phone in a chaotic Raspberry Pi-powered robot bird, 
                    one teenage girl's mission to build an entire phone including notes, the weather, a camera and texts, as well as 
                    less conventional features like self-balancing, text-to-speech and a custom PCB and 3D printed shell. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The bird is powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero with a Raspberry Pi camera, a round touchscreen display,
                     speaker, rechargeable battery, power and USB breakout boards, a USB microphone and a standard 4G 
                     modem dongle for internet and texts. It's a decidedly amateur build which pushed me to my limits as I
                     struggled to compress a variety of incompatible libraries into the Pi's miniscule storage, teaching me
                     about the backend of modems, image recognition algorithms, accelerometer boards and most importantly, the miracle 
                     that modern phones can fit all this and more in such as small rectangle and be so simultaneously boring and addictive. 
                </p>

                </h3>
                <p>
					This is the documentation/code for Tori Tortoise, my year 9 and 10 Personal Project robot. The robot has 8 servos, 2 for each leg. 
					It takes in positional data from an ultrasonic distance sensor, and its actions are reported on an OLED display.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tori Tortoise was one of my first forays into robotics. Powered by an Arduino Uno, it had 4 independently moving legs and 
					some semblance of a walk cycle, as well as being my first time soldering a prototyping board to reduce the size and the most 
					iterations I have ever had for the fully 3D printed body. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I made this tortoise (an animal chosen because of its slowness and clumsiness, making my robot seem almost realistic) for my Year 9-10 
					MYP Personal Project, and it was one of the highlights of my school's exhibition, my segment from the school's marketing video for the 
					night is <a href='https://youtu.be/gjwFHdaodQ0?si=eR2iQTpRwwssz-YA&t=23'>here at 0:23 of the video.</a>.

					This is my Year 12 HSC Software Engineering Major Project, made with Flask and a SQLite database in the backend, which aims to liberate online music 
					listening from megalomaniacal corporations. It is free, simple, does not require an account or a membership to use and, most importantly, allows users 
					to listen to any song or album chronologically, without ads or random songs in the queue.

						<div class="testimonial">
							Arabella has demonstrated diligence, focus and persistence throughout her time at St Andrew's Cathedral School. 
							A highly capable student, she has consistently set demanding standards for herself and worked resolutely towards 
							achieving them. More broadly, in other aspects of her school life, Arabella has approached her responsibilities 
							with a clear sense of efficacy, reliability and commitment. She has been servant-hearted in her commitment to House 
							activities, from being a Peer Support leader to being a House Officer and she has been a role model for others in 
							her willingness to participate. She is a reflective and honest person whose loyalty and integrity have seen her 
							develop a strong circle of good friends.
