                        Procrastinating on my HSC by doing Uni robotics content. I'm Arabella, a final year high school student passionate about 
						robotics, python and open-source experimentation. I'm commited to documenting my work and making it as simple and 
						effective as possible, so that hopefully I can inspire others. At school I'm ranked first in Software Engineering and 
						Engineering Studies, and I'm also studying Physics and Maths Extension 2 for my HSC.

                    Challenging my attention span and the idea of a phone in a chaotic Raspberry Pi-powered robot bird, 
                    one teenage girl's mission to build an entire phone including notes, the weather, a camera and texts, as well as 
                    less conventional features like self-balancing, text-to-speech and a custom PCB and 3D printed shell. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The bird is powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero with a Raspberry Pi camera, a round touchscreen display,
                     speaker, rechargeable battery, power and USB breakout boards, a USB microphone and a standard 4G 
                     modem dongle for internet and texts. It's a decidedly amateur build which pushed me to my limits as I
                     struggled to compress a variety of incompatible libraries into the Pi's miniscule storage, teaching me
                     about the backend of modems, image recognition algorithms, accelerometer boards and most importantly, the miracle 
                     that modern phones can fit all this and more in such as small rectangle and be so simultaneously boring and addictive. 
                </p>

                <p>
					This is the documentation/code for Tori Tortoise, my year 9 and 10 Personal Project robot. The robot has 8 servos, 2 for each leg. 
					It takes in positional data from an ultrasonic distance sensor, and its actions are reported on an OLED display.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tori Tortoise was one of my first forays into robotics. Powered by an Arduino Uno, it had 4 independently moving legs and 
					some semblance of a walk cycle, as well as being my first time soldering a prototyping board to reduce the size and the most 
					iterations I have ever had for the fully 3D printed body. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I made this tortoise (an animal chosen because of its slowness and clumsiness, making my robot seem almost realistic) for my Year 9-10 
					MYP Personal Project, and it was one of the highlights of my school's exhibition, my segment from the school's marketing video for the 
					night is <a href='https://github.com/boatartist/Tori-Tortoise/blob/main/tori%20tortoise%20myp%20school%20youtube%20video.mp4'>on my github page</a>.

                    A Spotify alternative which encourages listening to albums as they were intended, removing ads and scrambling from the music listening experience.

					This is my Year 12 HSC Software Engineering Major Project, made with Flask and a SQLite database in the backend, which aims to liberate online music 
					listening from megalomaniacal corporations. It is free, simple, does not require an account or a membership to use and, most importantly, allows users 
					to listen to any song or album chronologically, without ads or random songs in the queue.
